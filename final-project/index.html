                        When Shohei Ohtani stands on the mound and stares into his catcher for a sign, his mouth is
                        slightly open and his chin is raised just a little, giving off the impression he's every bit as
                        curious as we are to discover what might come next. He comes set neck-high and stares somewhere
                        over the top of the third-base dugout before his left leg rises slowly and accelerates quickly
                        as he descends the mound and the ball releases. The motion seems too easy to produce such force.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Ohtani walks to the batter's box from the on-deck circle, he stops several feet up the
                        first-base line and takes a sweeping practice swing that could be interpreted as a warning. He
                        tips the bill of his helmet to the umpire and spreads his feet wide in the box, as if intent on
                        occupying every inch of it. He holds his hands above his left ear, the bat nearly vertical, like
                        he's about to plant a flag or drive a stake. And when he swings, when he completes a slight hip
                        turn to the back and moves his front foot forward and decides to unleash the full power of his
                        large frame, it is somehow both elegant and furious, the swing of a man violently swirling a
                        cape from his left shoulder to his right.

                        Beauty is a word we underuse in sports. It's risky, easily misinterpreted, open for ridicule.
                        But the word can be unavoidable, as it is now, when engaged in the act of watching Ohtani play
                        baseball. It is a gift to share in his gifts, and if that's not beauty then language has no
                        meaning.

                        Ohtani, 27, is among the four or five best in the world at two of the most celebrated acts in
                        sports, throwing a baseball fast and hitting one far. He seems to exist somewhere above the
                        game, not in an arrogant sense but in an almost ethereal one, and this season, for all its
                        historic volume, feels like an ongoing series of grace notes. There are numbers, of course, that
                        both numb and blow the mind -- 45 homers, 24 stolen bases, 99 runs, 98 RBIs, 156 K's in 130â…“
                        innings on the mound -- but Ohtani's season will live most indelibly not in data but in memory
                        and anecdote.

                        You will not hear from Ohtani here. He is perhaps the single person least interested in
                        contextualizing what has happened this season. So consumed with the day-to-day, the ritual and
                        routine, the relentless mission to prove himself, he has decided he cannot submit to the mundane
                        requests of the world. He retains, even to those who practically cohabitate with him over the
                        course of a baseball season, an air of mystery.

                        But his teammates, coaches and manager have had a front-row seat to history, and they speak of
                        experiencing something deeper than simply a great season. Many of these men, after all, have
                        watched Mike Trout go about the daily task of becoming one of baseball's all-time greats but
                        this feels different. Pitcher Alex Cobb realized at some point in May, when he was getting
                        treatment in the trainer's room and Ohtani was coming to bat, that he needed to be outside, to
                        watch in person. "I can't miss any of this," he says. "This is historic."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It demands big answers to big questions. The one I've asked Angels pitching coach Matt Wise --
                        what has Ohtani taught you, in a cosmic sense, about limits and goals and human possibility? --
                        is admittedly a solar system or two distant from the normal baseball fare. But Wise is game, and
                        after a quick laugh he looks out from the Angels' dugout, to some faraway place beyond center
                        field where the cosmic answers are found.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Cosmically?" he asks. "Man. Man. I don't know. There's a definite discipline to the way Shohei
                        goes about every minute of his day, which means the physical gifts he has are not wasted, and
                        that's probably the most inspiring thing. He is very, very thoughtful in how he goes about
                        everything, and that has inspired me in dealing with my own kids. I know I keep using that word
                        -- inspiring -- because that's exactly what it is. He doesn't waste any of what he's been
                        given."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Possibilities exist that didn't before. Eyes have opened and horizons have widened. From this
                        point forward, it will be difficult to say something can't be done, because Ohtani is doing
                        something nobody could ever do.

                        Out near the wall in left-center field at Angel Stadium, almost close enough to catch some mist
                        off the big fake waterfall in center, there is a piece of ground that tells a story. This patch
                        is maybe three feet by three feet, and it is notable for being the only disturbed spot of earth
                        amid the wide green perfection of a big-league field. The grounds crew tries to keep it green,
                        reseeding and even painting, but its restoration will have to wait for the offseason. This spot,
                        which someday may require its own historical marker, is where Ohtani stands when he warms up.

                    <p>
                        On the days he pitches and the days he doesn't, Ohtani walks to that very spot with his
                        translator/friend/assistant Ippei Mizuhara a stride and a half behind him. Ohtani's walk is
                        slow, a star's walk, like a Formula One car easing up to the starting line. He is listed at 6-4
                        and 210 pounds, and he is the rare athlete whose size appears to exceed official measurements.
                        When he walks, his arms swing and his chest goes forward just enough to convey the idea that he
                        understands his place in the world but would rather someone else serve as messenger.

                        Mizuhara wears the same red backpack every day, and when they reach the spot he opens the pack
                        and places six weighted plyo balls -- the heaviest 4.4 pounds, the lightest 3.5 ounces -- in a
                        razor-straight line about 20 feet behind Ohtani and tosses him the heaviest one. Ohtani stands
                        facing second base, with his left foot in front, as if he is going to chuck the ball toward the
                        infield. Instead, he starts with the ball at his left hip and rotates his arm across his body to
                        fling it backward into the wall, as if he's discarding rotten fruit. Over and over he backhands
                        one weighted ball after another, 10 to 12 throws with each, the thump against the padded wall
                        like the beat of a drum, before turning and facing the wall to throw overhand with increasing
                        intensity, Mizuhara standing behind him holding a cellphone-sized radar gun, clocking every
                        toss.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "He is extremely regimented, in the amount of throws, in the entire routine," says Wise, the
                        pitching coach. "Exact same hole, exact same location, every time, all year long."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This routine is part of the reason that Ohtani is, by necessity, a man apart. The schedule he
                        keeps, from the weight room to the batting cage to the bullpen, had former teammate Tony Watson,
                        now with the Giants, joking that Ohtani must consider everyone else lazy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Friday, Sept. 3, Ohtani goes through his plyo ball routine as he prepares to start that night
                        against the Texas Rangers. He begins at 5:53 p.m., and at 6:11, 18 minutes and more than 100
                        plyo throws later, he takes a baseball from Wise and begins throwing lightly in the outfield.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By the time Ohtani climbs the stairs to the bullpen to throw off the mound, probably one in five
                        people in the stands are gathered close enough to raise a phone in his direction. ("I wouldn't
                        be any different," Wise says. "If I wasn't working here, I'd be standing down there watching
                        him, too.") As he throws off the mound, Mizuhara holds the radar gun over Ohtani's right
                        shoulder. After every few throws, Ohtani asks Mizuhara or Wise what time it is. Wise doesn't
                        know what each clock reading signifies, only that it matters. At 6:28, after 35 minutes of
                        throwing, and 12 minutes before he will throw the first pitch, he tips his cap to catcher Max
                        Stassi, signifying that he is finished, and walks through an elaborate pregame
                        handshake/fist-pump line, Ippei one step behind.

                    <p>
                        "There's not a lot of interaction on game day," Wise says. "It's literally me making sure he
                        doesn't twist an ankle going down the stairs, and that he has a baseball. I just watch. He's a
                        very interesting person."

                    <p>
                        As the fans jammed above and around the bullpen disperse and Ohtani heads for the dugout -- Wise
                        monitoring every stair step -- it's as good a time as any to report on the scene at Angel
                        Stadium. With Trout and Anthony Rendon and much of the starting rotation injured for most of the
                        season, there's not much else by way of excitement out here in the massive bowl of 55-year-old
                        concrete surrounded by asphalt a few blocks from the freeway. Mostly, people show up to watch
                        Ohtani. (The local television broadcast does its part, noting at the bottom of the screen when
                        Ohtani is due up the next inning. It's not part of a scroll, either, it's an alert, like a
                        weather warning: OHTANI TO HIT SECOND NEXT INNING.) There are ads throughout the stadium for
                        Japanese companies: Funai, Yakult, Daiso, Sapporo Ichiban Ramen Noodles ("Japan's No. 1 Pouch
                        Noodles"). Ohtani has impacted fashion, too; there are the expensive authentic Ohtani jerseys,
                        many with his name in Japanese. There are the more budget-oriented T-shirts, some with the team
                        store creases still sharp, and a sprinkling of short-sleeved bowling shirts with rows of
                        Ohtani's smiling face beaming kaleidoscopically.

                        The overall vibe of a game in Angel Stadium is typified by a scene in the lower concourse one
                        night during the Rangers series, when Ohtani flies out with runners on base to end an inning,
                        prompting a guy in a Nolan Ryan Rangers' jersey to run from section to section along the lower
                        concourse, screaming and dragging Angels' fans for their hero's failure. The response was not
                        anger but pity:
                        <i>Dude, it's Rangers-Angels in September -- nobody could possibly care this much.</i>

                        By now Ohtani's statistical anomalies have reached critical mass. He's become the first player
                        to do so many things that it is sufficient to simply say there is no precedent for any of it.
                        Sentences beginning "The first since..." long ago evolved into "The first ever..." The
                        particulars are never more than a few keystrokes away. Have at it. But on that Friday night
                        against the Rangers, a night he hit second in the lineup and threw a career-high 117 pitches
                        over seven innings, there was this moment: in danger of being removed in the seventh, after Wise
                        had paid him a visit to make sure he had a few more throws left in him, Ohtani's final three
                        pitches each traveled 99 mph.

                        "The only way I can relate to what he's doing is from the pitching side," Cobb says. "In the
                        four or five nights of the week I'm not pitching, I'm running these pitching thoughts through my
                        mind every night when I go to bed and every morning when I wake up. I look at him and I think,
                        Man, if he's struggling on either one, what kind of mental capacity does he have to have? I shut
                        down my golf game during the season because I don't have the mental energy to worry about both
                        my golf swing and my pitching."

                        The people who know Ohtani's routine contort themselves to avoid using the word obsessed, to the
                        point where they often say, "I'm not going to use the word obsessed, but..." If it is an
                        obsession, and the grass with the modest but unfulfilled goal of staying alive out near the wall
                        in left-center might conclude that it is, then it is an obsession occasioned by necessity. The
                        largeness of the task requires a condensed life. You might say that poor patch of grass had to
                        die for Ohtani to fully live.
